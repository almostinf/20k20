# 20k20
some algorithm task
Vladislav noticed that in 2020 there are two whole pairs of the same characters - 2 and 0. Based on this, he hated the numbers 2 and 0, as well as the situation when there are the same numbers in the year. Now Vladislav is waiting for the next year, in which there are no digits 2 and 0, and all the numbers are pairwise different. Calculate in which year it will happen for the first time?

Input data:

The first line of the input contains a single integer n - the current year. 0 <= n <= 10^9

Output:

Print one number - the next year, in which all digits are pairwise different, and there are no digits 2 and 0. If there will never be more such a year, print <<-1>> (without quotes).

 !!! NO BRUTFORCE !!!
